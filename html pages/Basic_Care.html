            Most hermit crabs you buy from pet stores are wild caught, due to the difficulty of breeding them in captivity. So we have to try our best to encapsulate a small part of their home within the limited space of our tank at home. Before we start talking about how to properly set up a crabitat, it is important to note that hermit crabs do NOT live on the beach. They are scavengers and will often visit the shore to hunt for food and shells. Hermit crabs tend to live more inland on a regular basis within the humid environment amongst the trees. They are more akin to rainforest creatures than beach creatures, so it is important to keep this in mind as we build their crabitat.

        <h3 id="tank size">Tank Size</h3>
        <p>Hermit crabs love to wander and climb. Since most hermit crabs are wild caught, it’s a huge adjustment to go from a wide open shoreline to the limited space of a tank. It is also important to take space into consideration as smaller spaces can cause hermit crabs to feel cramped and become aggressive. Ideally the amount of space needed to ensure proper space per crab is approximately 10 gallons per crab. You can allow about 5-10 gallons of space per crab, but the ideal amount of space for each crab to live comfortably is 10 gallons per crab.</p>

        <h2 id="food">Food, Water, and Diet</h2>
        <p>
            Hermit crabs are omnivores and scavengers by nature. There are several key nutrients required in order for a hermit crab to thrive in captivity. Since we are their main source of food now, it is important for us to give them the proper nutrition they need to safely and properly molt, regenerate and grow. It’s important to offer them a wide variety of foods so they can eat the nutrients their little bodies need. Here is a food pyramid demonstrating what their options should be daily, and how they can be moderated if needed (from most important foods at the bottom to everything else at the top).
